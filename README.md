# Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors

# Milestone 1

So I've woken up early to start my second rock paper scissors project and the first task requires capturing images on the teachable machine website. My first thought was 'look at the state of me!'. But this got me thinking; as a black woman who changes her hair very regularly, will this affect how my model is trained? It is such a minute detail but something I really wanted to explore as I can imagine if this does have an affect, it may also go on to play a part in video game simulations and VR activities. So my first aim was to create machine that was as accurate as possible. In order to do this, it meant firstly, getting ready for the day (and getting much needed coffee) and getting as many people involved with playing rock paper scissors on my teachable machine.

I also decided to take a chance yesterday and have confidence in sharing my first project (Hangman) in the AiCore session and I'm so glad I did. Not only did it give me the confidence to know I did well, but also learning from others and seeing their approach helped to emphasise that this isn't like the maths GCSE papers I used to mark; there are many approaches and they all work.

I am still trying to get my head around GitHub though...

I've trained the machine, removing and adding images - though I am tempted to continue over time just to increase the accuracy as scissors is difficult. I considered also changing the hand symbols or using the actual items to add interaction with the environment.

# Milestone 2

Before continuing with the milestone, I had the opportunity to listen to a presentation explaining the links between biological networks and artificial networks.
Next, I set up the environment by getting familiar with the terminal and downloaded the relevant libraries. It was a battle trying to do it on windows but much more straight forward on the mac. I question wether it's because i have a mentality that it would be easier on iOS(?). 

There were a lot of commands to run in the terminal that I honestly didn't understand initially.
