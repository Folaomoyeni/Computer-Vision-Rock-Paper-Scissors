# Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors

# Milestone 1

So I've woken up early to start my second rock paper scissors project and the first task requires capturing images on the teachable machine website. My first thought was 'look at the state of me!'. But this got me thinking; as a black woman who changes her hair very regularly, will this affect how my model is trained? It is such a minute detail but something I really wanted to explore as I can imagine if this does have an affect, it may also go on to play a part in video game simulations and VR activities. So my first aim was to create machine that was as accurate as possible. In order to do this, it meant firstly, getting ready for the day (and getting much needed coffee) and getting as many people involved with playing rock paper scissors on my teachable machine.

I also decided to take a chance yesterday and have confidence in sharing my first project (Hangman) in the AiCore session and I'm so glad I did. Not only did it give me the confidence to know I did well, but also learning from others and seeing their approach helped to emphasise that this isn't like the maths GCSE papers I used to mark; there are many approaches and they all work.

I am still trying to get my head around GitHub though...
